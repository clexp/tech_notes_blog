This section chronicles the ongoing evolution of home lab infrastructure, from hardware selection to service deployment. These articles document real-world implementations of enterprise-grade technologies in home environments, including backup strategies, container orchestration, and automation workflows.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Infrastructure**: Hardware selection, network design, and capacity planning
- **Backup Systems**: ZFS replication, automated backup workflows, and disaster recovery
- **Containerization**: Docker, LXC, and service isolation strategies
- **Automation**: Scripting, monitoring, and process optimization
- **Storage**: File sharing, document management, and storage architectures

## Featured Topics

- Automated backup systems with ZFS and scheduled shutdowns
- Dual-homed NAS configurations for redundancy
- Docker containerization for home services
- LXC Samba containers for legacy protocol support
- Tailscale integration for secure remote access
