## üß† The Day My DNS Died (and Took My Network With It): A Sysadmin Lab Chronicle

_May 2025 ‚Äî Somewhere between coffee and chaos._

So there I was, deep in the bowels of my home lab, configuring `BIND9` for local DNS and `ISC DHCP Server` for dynamic IP leases. Everything was going fine ‚Äî too fine. My router (`rtr02`) was humming along, clients were getting IPs, DNS lookups worked... even reverse lookups were starting to take shape.

But I wanted _more_. I wanted **Dynamic DNS (DDNS)**, that mythical beast where DHCP clients register themselves in the DNS zone, auto-magically keeping hostnames and IPs in sync.

### üß® Enter: The Line That Killed Everything

Somewhere in my `dhcpd.conf`, I dropped in this innocent-looking line:

dhcpd

CopyEdit

`option host-name = config-option host-name;`

I'd seen it floating around in online forums. Surely it would help clients tell the server their hostnames... right?

Wrong.

The next thing I knew, everything started crumbling:

- The DHCP server wouldn't start.
    
- No clients could get an IP address.
    
- My laptop was marooned with no DNS.
    
- SSH into `rtr02` failed. **FAILED.**
    
- I found myself hunched over a monitor directly plugged into the router like it was 2002.
    

### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Diagnosing the Disaster

A few commands told the tale:

bash

CopyEdit

`systemctl status isc-dhcp-server`

‚Üí Failed to start. No helpful logs. Just broken dreams.

The culprit? That `option host-name = config-option host-name;` line. ISC DHCP doesn‚Äôt speak that syntax. It belongs to another world (like Kea DHCP or certain managed systems). It turns out **clients send their hostname already**, and BIND can accept those updates _if properly configured_. You don‚Äôt need to set it in DHCP.

### üîß The Fix

Back to basics:

- Removed the bad line from `dhcpd.conf`.
    
- Restarted `isc-dhcp-server` like a digital defibrillator:
    
    bash
    
    CopyEdit
    
    `sudo systemctl restart isc-dhcp-server`
    
- Clients rejoined the network. DNS came back. SSH worked. The lab lived again.
    

We even verified that our DNS zone (`testlab1.local`) had some auto-updating going on ‚Äî some `A` records were indeed dynamic. (Victory dance omitted but implied.)

### üí° Lessons Learned

- Don‚Äôt blindly copy config lines from the internet. Read the man pages. (_Really._)
    
- Keep your DHCP and DNS servers on static IPs.
    
- Use `nixos-rebuild --rollback` liberally. It‚Äôs there to save your skin.
    
- DDNS is cool ‚Äî but fragile. Start simple and add complexity carefully.

## ‚úÖ What‚Äôs Next?

After conquering the dragons of DNS and DHCP, I'm off to slay IPv6. Who knows what horrors (or hilarity) lie in wait? One thing‚Äôs for sure ‚Äî `ping6` will become my best friend.

Thanks for joining me on this networking odyssey. Stay tuned for more from the lab, where cables are plenty and syntax errors are lurking in every conf file.

_Happy hacking!_
