# Debugging a Broken WireGuard Tunnel: A Journey Through Routers, Relays, and Routing Tables

## Introduction

In a home lab far from the convenience of consumer plug-and-play, we had a plan: expose services running deep in a private lab network via a secure WireGuard tunnel to a public OpenBSD VPS. The goals were:

- Serve a static site (`100dop.clexp.net`) from the OpenBSD VPS
    
- Reverse proxy `blog.clexp.net` to an Nginx jail on a FreeBSD box behind double NAT
    
- Reverse proxy `books.clexp.net` to a Django app in a bhyve VM also behind that NAT
    

And it was all supposed to "just work."

Spoiler: it did not. But with persistence and some packet-fueled deduction, we found the culprit. Here's the journey.

## Architecture Recap

### Key Hosts:

- **cl_vps_01**: Public OpenBSD VPS at `46.23.95.221`, WireGuard IP `10.100.0.1`
    
- **tb02**: Private FreeBSD server behind double NAT, WireGuard IP `10.100.0.2`
    
- **rtr02**: Inner Ubuntu router doing NAT between the home LAN and the lab subnet
    

### Tunnel Goals:

- OpenBSD reverse proxies `blog` and `books` subdomains to the FreeBSD server via WireGuard.
    
- Jail for Nginx lives at `10.100.0.5`, VM for Django app at `10.100.0.6`
    
- Only HTTP flows through the tunnel; TLS terminates on the VPS.

## The Mystery: The Tunnel Handshakes, but Nothing Else Works

We had this WireGuard config:

```ini
[Interface]
PrivateKey = ...
ListenPort = 51820

[Peer]
PublicKey = ...
AllowedIPs = 10.100.0.0/24
```

We could run:

```sh
doas wg show
```

And see `latest handshake` entries. So the tunnel was up. But:

- `ping 10.100.0.2` â†’ nothing.
    
- `nc -vz 10.100.0.5 80` â†’ crickets.
    
- `relayctl show` â†’ relayd not connecting.
    

Everything looked dead _except_ for that tantalizing handshake.

---

## Diagnosis Phase

We suspected:

- PF firewall rules
    
- A missing route
    
- A broken relayd or httpd configuration
    
- NAT/firewall on `rtr02`
    

### 1. Checking Routing Tables

```sh
route -n show -inet
```

This showed no route for `10.100.0.0/24`. We had:

```
10.100.0.1         wg0
```

...but no subnet route. That meant OpenBSD didn't know how to reach other 10.100.0.x addresses!

### 2. Attempts to Fix It

We tried:

```sh
doas route add -net 10.100.0.0/24 -ifp wg0
```

And got:

```
Invalid argument
```

Then tried:

```sh
doas route add 10.100.0.0/24 wg0
```

```
wg0: bad address
```

After several syntactic misfires, the command that worked was:

```sh
doas route add 10.100.0.0/24 10.100.0.1
```

It felt wrong (adding a route to the subnet _via its own address?_), but it told OpenBSD: "Yes, 10.100.0.0/24 is reachable via this interface."

### 3. Immediate Breakthrough

```sh
ping 10.100.0.2
```

Success. Sweet, sweet ICMP.

## Understanding the Mechanics

In OpenBSD, `AllowedIPs` in WireGuard doesn't automatically insert a full subnet route the way Linux might. Only the peerâ€™s IP may be inserted (e.g. `10.100.0.2`).

So despite having `AllowedIPs = 10.100.0.0/24`, the OS did not know the route.

The fix:

```sh
doas route add 10.100.0.0/24 10.100.0.1
```

means:

> All traffic for 10.100.0.x â€” go to me (`10.100.0.1`) and I'll use `wg0` to send it.

## Firewall and Relayd Debugging

Next we confirmed:

- PF on `cl_vps_01` had rules like:
    

```pf
pass in on vio0 proto tcp from any to port 443
pass out on wg0 proto tcp to 10.100.0.5 port 80
```

- `relayd.conf`:
    

```
table <blog> { 10.100.0.5 }
relay "blog" {
  listen on 127.0.0.1 port 8080
  forward to <blog> port 80
  protocol "http"
}
```

- `httpd.conf`:
    

```conf
server "blog.clexp.net" {
  listen on * tls port 443
  tls {
    certificate "/etc/ssl/clexp.net.fullchain.pem"
    key "/etc/ssl/private/clexp.net.key"
  }
  location "/" {
    root "/htdocs/empty"
  }
}
```

- `doas httpd -n` and `doas relayd -n -f /etc/relayd.conf` both returned `configuration OK`
    

All set.

## DNS Confusion and Victory

Then:

```sh
curl blog.clexp.net
```

```
could not resolve host
```

Ah â€” the Namecheap DNS needed a refresh.

After updating A records for `blog.clexp.net`, `100dop.clexp.net`, and `books.clexp.net`, everything clicked into place:

```sh
curl https://blog.clexp.net
<h1>Hello from nginx in a FreeBSD jail</h1>
```

**Success.**

## Lessons Learned

### ðŸ§  Routing:

- OpenBSD does **not** auto-add subnet routes from `AllowedIPs`
    
- You may need to add explicit routes for the full subnet
    

### ðŸ§  Debugging Tools:

- `wg show` â†’ checks tunnel handshake
    
- `ping`, `nc -vz`, `sockstat` â†’ tests connectivity
    
- `pfctl -sr` â†’ confirm firewall rules
    
- `route -n show -inet` â†’ inspect routing tables
    
- `httpd -n`, `relayd -n -f` â†’ validate config syntax
    

### ðŸ§  Configuration:

- `httpd` on OpenBSD is simple and must offload anything fancy to `relayd`
    
- `relayd` can forward requests to remote IPs over tunnels
    
- PF must allow not just inbound 443, but also loopback 80 (relayd uses this)

## Closing Thoughts

What started as a basic reverse proxy setup turned into a hands-on lesson in routing, tunnel behavior, and OpenBSD peculiarities.

There were a few moments of confusion and a lot of `Invalid argument`, but in the end, it was just a missing route.

Next time your tunnel handshakes but won't pass traffic â€” **check the route.**
