Zola provides powerful built-in image processing capabilities that automatically optimize images for web delivery. This guide demonstrates how to use these features effectively in your technical blog.

## Basic Image Processing

### Single Image with Auto-Processing

Here's how to use the basic image shortcode:

```markdown
{{/* image(path="images/server-setup.jpg", alt="Server setup diagram", caption="Complete network topology for home lab setup") */}}
```

This will automatically:

- Resize the image to 800px width (configurable)
- Convert to WebP format for better compression
- Add proper alt text and captions
- Include lazy loading for performance

### Custom Sizing and Operations

You can customize the processing parameters:

```markdown
{{/* image(path="images/network-diagram.png", width=1200, height=800, op="fit", format="webp", quality=90, alt="Network diagram") */}}
```

**Available operations:**

- `fit_width`: Resize to fit width, maintain aspect ratio
- `fit_height`: Resize to fit height, maintain aspect ratio
- `fit`: Resize to fit within dimensions
- `fill`: Crop to fill exact dimensions
- `scale`: Scale without maintaining aspect ratio

## Responsive Images

For optimal performance across devices, use the responsive image shortcode:

```markdown
{{/* responsive_image(path="images/server-rack.jpg", alt="Server rack configuration", caption="Production-ready server deployment") */}}
```

This generates multiple sizes (400px, 800px, 1200px) and uses `srcset` for automatic browser selection.

## Image Galleries

Create professional galleries with automatic thumbnail generation:

```markdown
{{/* gallery(path="screenshots", columns=3, thumb_width=300, thumb_height=200) */}}
```

This will:

- Process all images in the `screenshots` folder
- Generate thumbnails at 300×200px
- Create a responsive grid layout
- Link thumbnails to full-size images

### Gallery Organization

For galleries, organize images in folders:

```
content/
├── networking/
│   ├── my-post.md
│   └── my-post/
│       ├── diagram1.png
│       ├── diagram2.png
│       └── screenshot.jpg
```

## Performance Benefits

Zola's image processing provides several performance advantages:

### Automatic WebP Conversion

- Modern browsers get WebP format (smaller file sizes)
- Fallback to original format for older browsers
- Typically 25-35% smaller than JPEG

### Lazy Loading

- Images load only when needed
- Improves initial page load times
- Better user experience on mobile

### Responsive Images

- Appropriate image size for each device
- Reduces bandwidth usage
- Faster loading on mobile devices

## Advanced Usage

### Custom CSS Classes

Add custom styling to images:

```markdown
{{/* image(path="images/terminal.png", class="terminal-screenshot", alt="Terminal output") */}}
```

### Format Selection

Choose optimal formats for different content:

```markdown
{{/* image(path="images/diagram.png", format="png", quality=95) */}} <!-- Keep PNG for diagrams -->
{{/* image(path="images/photo.jpg", format="webp", quality=80) */}} <!-- WebP for photos -->
```

### Batch Processing

For multiple images in a post, place them in a folder with the same name as your post:

```
content/
├── system-admin/
│   ├── my-tutorial.md
│   └── my-tutorial/
│       ├── step1.png
│       ├── step2.png
│       └── result.jpg
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Image Organization

- Use descriptive filenames
- Group related images in folders
- Keep original high-quality sources

### 2. Format Selection

- **Photos**: Use WebP with 80-85% quality
- **Diagrams/Screenshots**: Use PNG for crisp lines
- **Icons**: Use SVG when possible

### 3. Sizing Guidelines

- **Hero images**: 1200px width maximum
- **Content images**: 800px width for most cases
- **Thumbnails**: 300px width for galleries

### 4. Alt Text

- Always provide descriptive alt text
- Describe the content, not just "image"
- Keep it concise but informative

## Directory Structure

Your image assets should be organized as:

```
static/
├── images/
│   ├── common/          # Shared images
│   ├── networking/      # Section-specific images
│   └── system-admin/    # Section-specific images

content/
├── section/
│   ├── post.md
│   └── post/           # Post-specific images
│       ├── image1.jpg
│       └── image2.png
```

## Processed Images Storage

Zola automatically stores processed images in:

- `static/processed_images/` during build
- Images are cached and only re-processed when changed
- Different sizes/formats stored as separate files

This image processing system provides professional-grade image optimization while maintaining simplicity in your markdown workflow. The automatic WebP conversion and responsive image generation ensure optimal performance across all devices and connection speeds.
