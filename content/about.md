## About This Blog

Welcome to my technical blog where I document my journey through networking, system administration, and home lab experiments. This space serves as both a personal knowledge base and a resource for fellow enthusiasts exploring similar technical challenges.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog covers a diverse range of technical topics:

- **Networking**: IPv6 setup, DNS configuration, DHCP management, and VPN implementations
- **System Administration**: Server setup and management across various operating systems (OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Ubuntu, NixOS)
- **Home Lab Adventures**: Real-world implementations, troubleshooting guides, and lessons learned
- **Infrastructure**: Docker containers, LXC, virtualization, and automation
- **Security**: Firewall configuration, secure tunnel setup, and network security practices

## Philosophy

Every post here comes from hands-on experience - the successes, failures, and everything in between. I believe in:

- **Documentation**: Recording the journey, not just the destination
- **Practical Learning**: Real implementations over theoretical discussions
- **Problem-Solving**: Sharing debugging processes and solutions
- **Continuous Learning**: Exploring new technologies and approaches

## Technical Background

My experience spans across various technologies and platforms:

- **Operating Systems**: Extensive work with BSD systems (OpenBSD, FreeBSD), Linux distributions, and some exploration of NixOS
- **Networking**: VLAN configuration, DNS/DHCP setup, VPN implementations (WireGuard), and IPv6 deployment
- **Containers & Virtualization**: Docker, LXC, and various virtualization platforms
- **Automation**: Scripting, configuration management, and automated backup solutions

## Why Share?

Technical documentation serves multiple purposes:

1. **Personal Reference**: A searchable record of configurations and solutions
2. **Community Contribution**: Helping others who face similar challenges
3. **Learning Reinforcement**: Writing about implementations deepens understanding
4. **Professional Growth**: Demonstrating technical capabilities and problem-solving skills

## Get in Touch
