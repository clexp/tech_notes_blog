# ðŸ§  The Day My DNS Died (and Took My Network With It): A Sysadmin Lab Chronicle

*May 2025 â€” Somewhere between coffee and chaos.*

So there I was, deep in the bowels of my home lab, configuring `BIND9` for local DNS and `ISC DHCP Server` for dynamic IP leases. Everything was going fine â€” too fine. My router (`rtr02`) was humming along, clients were getting IPs, DNS lookups worked... even reverse lookups were starting to take shape.
