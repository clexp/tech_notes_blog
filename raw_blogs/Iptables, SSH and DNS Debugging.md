### Adventures in Firewall Rules, VLANs, and DNS: Lessons from the Lab

It‚Äôs been a productive and occasionally nerve-wracking stretch in the lab. This latest chapter of the journey took us deep into the thickets of `iptables`, VLAN networking, and DNS server configuration on `rtr02`. Here‚Äôs a rundown of what went down, what went wrong, and what we learned.

---

#### üîí The SSH Lockout Incident (a.k.a. "Oops")

It started with a perfectly reasonable idea: clean up some `iptables` rules that were cluttering the configuration. The `INPUT` chain had an early rule:

```
1    ACCEPT     tcp  --  0.0.0.0/0  0.0.0.0/0  tcp dpt:22
```

It seemed broad. Maybe too broad? So we deleted it, thinking we had better control via more precise rules elsewhere. Then: _bam!_ SSH from the inside stopped working, and worse, we were locked out of `rtr02`.

**Lesson:** If you‚Äôre going to touch `iptables` with a `DROP` default policy, **never delete SSH rules before confirming your new rules work.**

**Fix:** Fortunately, we were still logged in via an existing session, which survived because of the RELATED,ESTABLISHED rule. A quick `iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp --dport 22 -s 192.168.1.0/24 -j ACCEPT` restored access.

#### üß± Understanding Systemd Quirks: The bind9 Enablement Oddity

Another confusing moment came when trying to enable `bind9` using systemd:

```
sudo systemctl enable bind9
```

This failed with:

```
Failed to enable unit: Refusing to operate on alias name or linked unit file: bind9.service
```

Turns out that `bind9` is an **alias** for the real systemd service name, `named.service`. To avoid confusion:

```
sudo systemctl enable named
```

**Lesson:** When systemctl complains about aliases, it‚Äôs usually hinting that you should use the canonical unit name.

#### üåê DNS is Up, but IPv6 is Loud

With `named` running, we noticed recurring log entries:

```
network unreachable resolving 'ns-1554.awsdns-02.co.uk/AAAA/IN': 2600:9000:...#53
```

These are IPv6 DNS resolution attempts failing. Since this lab is IPv4-only, the IPv6 requests were just noise. No harm done, but worth knowing why they're showing up.

**Lesson:** If you're IPv4-only, you can suppress IPv6 noise by either disabling IPv6 entirely or adjusting `named.conf.options` to prefer IPv4.

#### üîÅ Forwarding Rules: Are They Always Necessary?

We spotted this rule in the `FORWARD` chain:

```
5    ACCEPT     tcp  --  0.0.0.0/0  10.0.0.50  tcp dpt:22 state NEW,RELATED,ESTABLISHED
```

This looked overly specific. Do we really need to forward SSH traffic to a test machine? Not unless we‚Äôre exposing that host via port forwarding or DMZ-style access. Since routing alone can do the job inside the lab, the rule was removed.

**Lesson:** If all traffic is internal and routes are configured, you may not need explicit FORWARD rules unless you‚Äôre restricting by default or want precise control.

#### ‚úÖ Takeaways and Habits to Adopt

- **Use `iptables -I` to insert temporary rules** while testing. Save only after confirming stability.
    
- **Always whitelist SSH early** in your rule chain if your default policy is `DROP`.
    
- **Check your current SSH session before deleting rules.** Related sessions stay up thanks to the `ESTABLISHED` rule.
    
- **Use `named` instead of `bind9` with systemctl.**
    
- **Know when you're in a NAT vs routing scenario.** Routing doesn't need DNAT rules unless you're exposing services across boundaries.

What‚Äôs next? We‚Äôre turning our attention back to DNS ‚Äî now that our local resolver is working, dynamic DNS is on the horizon. And maybe a splash of VLAN segregation magic. Until then, keep your SSH ports open and your chains clean.
